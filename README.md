#  Palindrome Checker (Java)

A simple and interactive **Java console application** that checks whether a given word or phrase is a **palindrome**.

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter case.

---

## 🚀 Features
-  Accepts word or full phrase input
-  Ignores spaces and special characters
-  Case-insensitive comparison
-  Simple and user-friendly console interface

---

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Java**
- Scanner class for user input
- String manipulation (`replaceAll()`, `toLowerCase()`)
- Loop for reversing string
- Conditional statements (if–else)

---

## 🔄 How It Works
1. User enters a word or phrase.
2. The program removes spaces and punctuation.
3. Converts the text to lowercase.
4. Reverses the cleaned string.
5. Compares both strings to check if it is a palindrome.
6. Displays the result.

It is a palindrome.

---Palindrome Checker---
Enter a word or phrase: hello
It is not a palindrome.
```
